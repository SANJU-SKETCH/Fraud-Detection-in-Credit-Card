## About

This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze credit card transaction data and classify transactions as legitimate or fraudulent, improving security and reducing financial losses.

---

## Features

- Real-time fraud detection  
- Imbalanced data handling using techniques like SMOTE  
- Feature engineering and selection  
- Model evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Supports multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection:** Acquire credit card transaction datasets with labeled fraudulent and legitimate transactions.  
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean data, handle missing values, and normalize or scale features.  
3. **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Apply oversampling or undersampling methods (e.g., SMOTE) to balance classes.  
4. **Feature Engineering:** Select and create relevant features to improve model performance.  
5. **Model Training:** Train machine learning models on the preprocessed dataset.  
6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using classification metrics and select the best-performing model.  
7. **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model to predict fraud in real-time transactions.
